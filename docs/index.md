# Introduction
Timeline.js is a lightweight jQuery plugin primarily intended for displaying a sequence of events in an attractive, interactive way. Whilst there are lots of Javascript libraries available for displaying events on a timeline in various formats, I couldn't find anything which did quite what I needed so I wrote timeline.js.

The project is hosted on <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}">GitHub</a>.
